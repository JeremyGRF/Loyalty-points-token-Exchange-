COLE TO ADD DIAGRAM

When a customer makes a purchase at one of the affiliated coporations (Best Buy, Nike, Starbucks, and Delta so far). They record the transaction in the streamlit site using the Exchange_app.py. They are then rewarded with the respective reward points as tokens. Their wallet then stores the balance of all these tokens. Or they can exchange those tokens into our Loyalty Exchange tokens to be stored in the exchangeable and central token. From the site, their balances are stored and can be referenced.
